## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s digital age, where children are glued to cartoons like Cocomelon, there is a need
for content that not only entertains but also nurtures young minds. The project aims to
educate these nascent minds through engaging stories that provide a positive moral learning
and at the same time make them culturally aware. The goal is to build a tool that can take a
simple idea and turn it into a complete animated story. By doing so, we can make it possible
for anyone, from parents to educators to creators, to share vibrant cultural stories with
children in a way that is fun, meaningful, and impactful.
